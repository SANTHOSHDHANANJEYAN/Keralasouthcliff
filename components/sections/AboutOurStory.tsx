            Asteya Story
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#555]">
            Asteya Villas was born from a heartfelt desire to offer a tranquil
            escape from the noise of everyday life where luxury and nature live
            in harmony. Nestled amidst serene landscapes, Asteya is a sanctuary
            designed for rest, reflection, and renewal. Each villa is carefully
            crafted to blend contemporary elegance with soulful charm, creating
            a space that inspires stillness and self-connection.
            <br />
            <br />
            At Asteya, we believe true luxury lies in simplicity and
            authenticity. Thatâ€™s why every detail from the architecture to the
            scents, sounds, and materials is curated to awaken your senses and
            ground you in the present moment. Whether you are here for a
            peaceful solo retreat, a romantic getaway, or a gathering of loved
            ones, our spaces nurture genuine connection with self, others, and
            nature.
            <br />
            <br />
            More than just a place to stay, Asteya is a philosophy of mindful
            living. It is where time slows down, distractions fade, and every
            moment is infused with presence.
